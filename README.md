# Luke Gorrie's blog

Howdy!

My name is [Luke Gorrie](http://lukego.com/) and the [Issues](https://github.com/lukego/blog/issues) here are where I blog.

I am a core developer of [Snabb](https://github.com/snabbco/snabb), [RaptorJIT](https://github.com/raptorjit/raptorjit), and [Studio](https://github.com/studio/studio). I work as a hired gun at [Snabb Solutions](http://snabb.solutions/). I love hearing kind words about my projects from strangers... :-)
